### Describe the raw data.

**Import and Clean Dataset**

- update the victim’s first and last name to proper case
- replace unknown to missing value NA
- update victim_age to numeric variable

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate (
    victim_last = str_to_title(victim_last),
    victim_first = str_to_title(victim_first),
    across(c(uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, disposition), ~na_if(., "Unknown")),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  )
```

**Describe the raw data**

- The datasaet contains data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities from
  2007 to 2017. The dataset contains 52179 total observations and 12
  variables.
- The variable records the id number of the cases (`uid`), the report
  date (`reported_date`),cities and state of the cases (`city` and
  `state`), the detailed case location (`lat` and `lon`) and the case
  status on whether it is open and closed (`disposition`). It also
  recoreds victim’s name (`victim_last` and `victim_first`), race
  (`victim_race`), age (`victim_age`) and gender(`victim_sex`).

### Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homicide_df = homicide_df |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))|>
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 

homicide_disposition = homicide_df|>
  group_by(city_state)|>
  summarise(
    total_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest","Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), na.rm = TRUE),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), na.rm = TRUE)
    )

print(homicide_disposition)
```

    ## # A tibble: 50 × 3
    ##    city_state      total_homicides unsolved_homicides
    ##    <chr>                     <int>              <int>
    ##  1 Albuquerque, NM             378                146
    ##  2 Atlanta, GA                 973                373
    ##  3 Baltimore, MD              2827               1825
    ##  4 Baton Rouge, LA             424                196
    ##  5 Birmingham, AL              800                347
    ##  6 Boston, MA                  614                310
    ##  7 Buffalo, NY                 521                319
    ##  8 Charlotte, NC               687                206
    ##  9 Chicago, IL                5535               4073
    ## 10 Cincinnati, OH              694                309
    ## # ℹ 40 more rows

### For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
homicide_disposition_baltimore = homicide_disposition |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

unsovled = homicide_disposition_baltimore |> 
  pull(unsolved_homicides)

total = homicide_disposition_baltimore |> 
  pull(total_homicides)

prop_test_baltimore = prop.test(unsovled, total)|>
  broom::tidy()|>
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

print(prop_test_baltimore)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

### run prop.test for each of the cities in the dataset, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

``` r
homicide_city = homicide_disposition |>
  mutate(
    prop_test_city = map2(unsolved_homicides, total_homicides, ~prop.test(.x,.y)),
    tidy_test_city = map(prop_test_city, broom::tidy)
  )|>
  unnest(tidy_test_city)|>
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
  
print(homicide_city)
```

    ## # A tibble: 50 × 4
    ##    city_state      estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##    <chr>              <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ##  1 Albuquerque, NM    0.386    0.337     0.438
    ##  2 Atlanta, GA        0.383    0.353     0.415
    ##  3 Baltimore, MD      0.646    0.628     0.663
    ##  4 Baton Rouge, LA    0.462    0.414     0.511
    ##  5 Birmingham, AL     0.434    0.399     0.469
    ##  6 Boston, MA         0.505    0.465     0.545
    ##  7 Buffalo, NY        0.612    0.569     0.654
    ##  8 Charlotte, NC      0.300    0.266     0.336
    ##  9 Chicago, IL        0.736    0.724     0.747
    ## 10 Cincinnati, OH     0.445    0.408     0.483
    ## # ℹ 40 more rows

### Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides.

``` r
homicide_city |>
  mutate(city_state = reorder(city_state, estimate))|>
  ggplot(aes(x=city_state, y =estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  labs(
    title = "Proportion Estimate and Confidance Interval of Unsolved Homicides In US Cities ",
    x = "Cities and States",
    y = "Proportion Estimate",
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

### Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time

- Start with a dataframe containing all file names using `list.files`
  function
- Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
  `purrr::map` and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
- Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
  subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other
  tidying that’s necessary

``` r
longit_study_df = 
  tibble(
    file_name = list.files("./data/p2", full.names = TRUE))|> 
    # using `full.names = True` to use the file path as the value instead of file name
  mutate(
    data = purrr::map (file_name, ~ read_csv(.x, show_col_types = FALSE)),
    subject_id = str_extract(file_name, "\\d{2}"), 
    #extract 2 digits numbers from the file_name
    arm = if_else(str_detect(file_name, "con"), "control", "experimental"),
    #if detect "con" in `file_name`, make the value "control", else make the value "experimental" 
    subject_id = fct_relevel(subject_id, "01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10"),
  )|>
  select(subject_id, arm, data)|>
  unnest(data)|>
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation"
  ) |>
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))
```

### Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
longit_study_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation,)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = subject_id)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = subject_id)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = arm), method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Obsservation on Each Subject Over Time ",
    x = "Time in Week",
    y = "Observation Data",
    color = "ID and Arm"
    ) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw5_tw2918_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
longit_study_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = subject_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_tw2918_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
  labs(
    title = "Obsservation on Each Subject Over Time ",
    x = "Time in Week",
    y = "Observation Data",
    color = "ID and Arm"
    ) 
```

    ## $x
    ## [1] "Time in Week"
    ## 
    ## $y
    ## [1] "Observation Data"
    ## 
    ## $colour
    ## [1] "ID and Arm"
    ## 
    ## $title
    ## [1] "Obsservation on Each Subject Over Time "
    ## 
    ## attr(,"class")
    ## [1] "labels"

*comment on differences between groups*

- The starting observation value in week 1 is similar and mixed between
  the two arms. The observation value increases for the experimental arm
  over time and is higher than the control arm starting in week 2. The
  observation value for control group stayed stable aover time from
  week1 to week 8.

## Problem 3

sigma = 5
mu = 0
num_simulations = 5000

sim_ttest = function (n, mu, sigma) {
  
  sample = rnorm (n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  t_test = t.test(sample, mu=0)
  result = broom::tidy(t_test) |>
    select(estimate, p.value)
  
}

sim_results = map_dfr(1:num_simulations, ~ sim_ttest(n, mu, sigma))

print(sim_results)
```

}

sim_mu_and_ttest = function(mu) {
  map_dfr(1:num_simulations, function(x) sim_ttest(n=30, mu=mu, sigma = 5))
}

sim_results_all = map_dfr(mu_value, sim_mu_and_ttest, .id = "mu")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(mu = as.numeric(mu))

print(sim_results_all)

### Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
sim_results_all |>
  group_by(mu)|>
  summarize (power = mean(p_value < 0.05))|>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = power))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Power Over True Value of μ ",
    x = "True Value of μ",
    y = "Power of the Test"
    ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_tw2918_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

*Association between effect size and power*

- The plot shows a positive association between effect size and power
  that as the true value of μ increases, the power of the test also
  increases, indicating larger effect sizes are easier to detect. When
  the effect size is small (values of μ close to 0), the test has less
  power, which means it is less likely to reject the null hypothesis
  even if it is false. As the effect size grows, the test becomes more
  likely to reject the null hypothesis.
- The plot shows that the the slope or the increase in power is getting
  flatter, as the true value μ gets large, suggesting that once the
  effect size is sufficiently large, further increases in the effect
  size do not substantially increase power, likely because the power is
  already close to 1. At this point, the test will almost always
  correctly reject the null hypothesis.

### Make a plot showing the average estimate of μ̂ on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis, and the average estimate of μ̂ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis

``` r
sim_results_all |>
  group_by(mu)|>
  summarize (
    average_estimate_all = mean(estimate),
    average_estimate_rejected = mean(estimate[p_value < alpha])
    )|>
  pivot_longer(
    average_estimate_all: average_estimate_rejected,
    names_to = "average_estimate_group",
    names_prefix = "average_estimate_",
    values_to = "average_estimate_value"
  )|>
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = average_estimate_value, color = average_estimate_group))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Estimate of μ Hat Over True Value of μ ",
    x = "True Value of μ",
    y = "Average Estimate of μ Hat"
    ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_tw2918_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

*Result*

- From the plot, it appears that the average estimate of when the null
  is rejected (yellow line) is consistently above the line for all tests
  (purple line), and both are increasing with the true value of μ.
- The sample average of μ̂ across tests for which the null is rejected
  does not equal to the true value of μ when the true value of μ is
  small. As the true value of μ increase, the sample average of μ̂ across
  tests for which the null is reject is getting closer to the true value
  and approximately equal to the true value when the true value is equal
  and above 4.
- This is because, when the true value of μ is small,there’s magnitude
  error, which is rejecting null hypothesis base on random chance or
  sampling variability. Therefore the the average estimate from these
  samples is biased upwards. And when the true value of μ is large, the
  power of the test becomes high, and the sample estimates of μ are more
  consistently close to the true μ.
